Shibboleth
==========

2020-02-05: This fork was created from the pull request https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/pull/59 to add an option to allow no account creation. It was forked to add a composer.json to allow deployment using the package manager.

This is the official development repository (as of version 1.8) for the [Shibboleth plugin for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/shibboleth), originally by [Will Norris](https://github.com/willnorris) and [Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine](https://github.com/mitcho).

Read [readme.txt](https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/blob/master/readme.txt) for usage information.
